### Business Activities

**Q: What specific problem is the company or project trying to solve?**  
A: IonQ is currently exploring better ways to load cargo or reduce fuel consumption with Airbus,  researching optimized lithium compounds in batteries with the Hyundai Motor Company, and more.
IonQ in general is trying to solve the problem of how to further quantum computers scale and it can apply to cutting edge problems we have now.

**Q: Who is the company's intended customer? Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers?**  
A: Quantum developers, partners, researchers. 
>"Airbus is deploying IonQ Forte to co-develop an aircraft loading optimization algorithm that utilizes 28 qubits to execute full variational optimization of a quantum circuit, the largest variational optimization performed on a QPU to date."

**Q: What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?)**  
A: They are researching and constructing more advanced quantum computers in order to take advantage of quantum computing for applications in AI and Machine Learning.

**Q: Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them?**  
A: They have an array of products: IonQ Aria, IonQ Harmony, and IonQ Forte. These products are limited to quantum computers of varying amounts of qbits. Aria has 25 algorithmic qbits (#AQ 25), Harmony has 11 algorithmic qubits (#AQ 11), Forte has 36 algorithmic qubits (#AQ 36).

**Q: How can you get involved?**
A: IonQ Aria and IonQ Harmony are cloud accessible via Google, Amazon Braket, Microsoft Azure and IonQ Quantum Cloud.

### Landscape

**Q: What field is the company in?**  
A: Quantum Computing, Cloud Computing

**Q: What have been the major trends and innovations of this field over the last 5–10 years?**  
A: With quantum computing we can train models to recognize objects using fewer input parameters than classical approaches.

**Q: What are the other major companies in this field?**  
A: IBM, NVIDIA, Atom Computing

### Results

**Q: What has been the business impact of this company so far?**  
A: They are making a move to cloud computing, so they are likely trying to capitalize off the fact that few people will have a quantum computer for the forseeable future and will charge people to use their machines, like a new age IBM.

**Q: What are some of the core metrics that companies in this field use to measure success? How is your company performing based on these metrics?**  
A: Algorithmic Qubits (#AQ), Gate Fidelity, Quantum Volume. They don't have the most qubits, but they're a relatively new company and the technology they use helps them excel in quantum volume and Gate Fidelity with the lowest error rates you can get by using trapped ions.

**Q: How is your company performing relative to competitors in the same field?**  
A: Atom Computing is up to 1000 bits. However, IonQ is building their systems on trapped ion systems which offer the lowest gate error rate of any quantum technology right now. This means that there will be fewer qubits dedicated to error correction which means more qubits and smaller machines. IonQ introduced the first commercial trapped ion quantum computer in Q4 2018. They are now up to 36 qubits. Google revealed its quantum processeor that consists of 53 qubits in 2019. So we can see that with less funding of a corporation like Google and having started so soon. IonQ is performing fairly competitively.

### Recommendations

**Q: If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer?**  
A: They should probably invest in their own data centers rather than partnering with Dell to bring cloud computing hosting. That way they can charge industries to train AI models using their quantum computers or in the future begin to sell the quantum computers for training much like NVIDIA sells A100s.

**Q: Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?**  
A: I think they could elevate their bottomline and break even sooner. Like how OpenAI started subscription services for their ChatGPT product. 

**Q: What technologies would this additional product or service utilize?**  
A: If they were to invest in their own data centers, they would be the biggest buyers of their own product. They would need their quantum processors, and cloud computing platforms like AWS or Azure. 

**Q: Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?**  
A: It would make sense for the company to run its own datacenters since quantum computers require cryogenic cooling. By owning their own data centers they can ensure that the specs of the centers are set to allow for their computers to run optimally.
